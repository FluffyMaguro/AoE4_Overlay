  * Simple TXT format.
  * Illustrated with resources distribution and game pictures (+ BO step selection).
* Supports a highly customizable streaming overlay (with CSS/JS).

API calls are done through [AoE4World.com](https://aoe4world.com/). For build orders, check [age4builder.com](https://age4builder.com/) or [aoe4guides.com](https://aoe4guides.com). 

# Notes

* I'm no longer working on this app. For build-order related issues tag [@CraftySalamander](https://github.com/CraftySalamander).
* Anti-virus complaining about the app is normal for packaged Python apps. If you don't believe the packaged app is secure, download the source code and run it with Python.

# How to use
**Windows**
* Download and extract the archive.
* Run `AoE4_Overlay.exe`.

**Linux** 
* ```cd ~/Documents```
* ```git clone https://github.com/FluffyMaguro/AoE4_Overlay.git```

</br>

* Find your profile by entering your profile ID, Steam ID or player name.
* Set up the hotkey for showing/hiding overlay.
  * Overlay will be automatically shown when a new game starts (or app starts).

# Build orders
  * Two build orders types are available:
    * *Simple TXT*
    * *Illustrated* with resources distribution and game pictures (+ BO step selection).
  * Add or remove build orders with **Add/Remove build order** (write the content on the left panel, and the title on the top of the right panel).
    * Write anything for the *Simple TXT format*.
    * For the *Illustrated format*, you need to have a JSON format compatible with the [RTS_Overlay](https://github.com/CraftySalamander/RTS_Overlay) from CraftySalamander (see examples [here](https://github.com/CraftySalamander/RTS_Overlay/tree/master/build_orders/aoe4)).
    * Many build orders can be downloaded from https://age4builder.com or from https://aoe4guides.com.
      * To get the *Simple TXT format*, click on **Simple TXT Build Order to clipboard** on the top of any open build order (`M` icon).
      * To get the *Illustrated format*, click on **Illustrated Build Order to clipboard** on the top of any open build order (**salamander** icon).
  * Change their order using **Move build order up/down**.
  * Set up hotkeys (with **Hotkey for/to...**) for showing/hiding overlay, cycling between build orders and selecting the previous/next step of a build order (only available for the *Illustrated format*).
    * Use the corresponding hotkeys to show/hide/cycle build orders and steps.
    * You can uncheck a build order so that it does not appear when cycling between the build orders with the dedicated hotkey.
  * Change the overlay font size with **Overlay font size**.
  * Change the height of the build order images (only for the *Illustrated format*) with **Overlay images height**.
  * Change the position of the build order overlay with **Change BO overlay position**. Once fixed, the upper right corner will never move, but the size of the overlay will be automatically adapted to its content.

# Streaming
To use the custom streaming overlay simply drag the `overlay.html` file to OBS or other streaming software. The file is located in `src/html` directory in the app folder. Move and rescale as necessary once some game information is shown.

If drag & drop doesn't work, add new source to your scene manually. The source type will be `Browser` and point to a local file `overlay.html`.

* Streaming overlay supports team games as well
* The streaming overlay can be fully customized with CSS and JS, see the next section.
* The override tab can be used to change the information on the overlay. This might be useful when casting from replays or changing a player's barcode to their actual name.

# Customization

1. **Overlay position and font size** can be changed in the app.

2. **Build order** (BO) font, images size, position and hotkeys can be changed in the app. Other attributes can also be customized in `config.json` (to find the file click `File/config & logs` in the app). You have to close the app before making changes to the config file. What can be changed:

    `"bo_show_title": true` : true to show the BO title, false otherwise

    `"bo_title_color": [230, 159, 0]` : color for the BO title

    `"bo_overlay_hotkey_show": ""` : hotkey to show/hide the BO

    `"bo_overlay_hotkey_cycle": ""` : hotkey to cycle between the different BO available

    `"bo_overlay_hotkey_previous_step": ""` : hotkey to go to the previous step of the BO

    `"bo_overlay_hotkey_next_step": ""` : hotkey to go to the next step of the BO

    `"bo_font_size": 12` : font size

    `"bo_text_color": [255, 255, 255]` : text RGB color

    `"bo_color_background": [30, 30, 30]` : background RGB color

    `"bo_font_police": 'Arial'` : police font

    `"bo_opacity": 0.75` : opacity of the window

    `"bo_upper_right_position": [1870, 70]` : position for the upper right corner

    `"bo_image_height": 30` : height of the images

    `"bo_border_size": 15` : size of the borders

    `"bo_vertical_spacing": 10` : vertical space between the BO lines

    The images used in the build order overlay can also be defined in the same configuration file (path relative to `src/img/build_order`).



3. **Team colors** can be changed in the `config.json`. Colors are stored as a list of RGBA colors for team 1, 2, and so on.

    ```json
    "team_colors": [
        [74, 255, 2, 0.35],
        [3, 179, 255, 0.35],
        [255, 0, 0, 0.35]
      ]
    ```
    
4. **Civilization stats color** can be changed in `config.json`.
    ```json
    "civ_stats_color": "#BC8AEA",
    ```

5. **Streaming overlay** customization can be done via `custom.css` and `custom.js` in the `html` folder in app directory. These files will not be overridden with an app update. Look at `main.css` to see what you can change. In `custom.js` you can define this function that runs after each update.

    ```javascript
    function custom_func(data) {
        console.log("These are all the player data:", data);
    }
    ```
