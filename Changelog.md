## in progress
* New BO civilizations from Season 6 added.

## [1.4.2] - 2022.10.26
* Build orders can be unchecked, so that they do not appear when cycling between the build orders with the dedicated hotkey.
* Malians and Ottomans added (Season 3).

## [1.4.0] - 2022.07.25
* The order of the build orders can be adapted with 'Move build order up/down'.
* Two format of build orders are available:
    * JSON format with images and resources distribution, adapted from the RTS Overlay of CraftySalamander.
    * Simple TXT format (compatible with legacy behaviour, using the same tools as the JSON format).
* New hotkeys: go to the previous/next step of the build order (only working for JSON format).
* Build order overlay image sizes can be adapted.
    * Other new settings available in the 'config.json' file. 
* New overlay icon.
